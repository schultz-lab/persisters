The data and MATLAB code to generate the results in the manuscript by Deng et al. (2026), "Quantifying drug-induced persisters reveals their heterogeneity and tolerance along a spectrum."

Folder (A) contains the general "SDTK_Fitting.m" code for fitting serial-dilution time-kill assay data (e.g., Fig 2 a,c). Folder (B) contains the general "Sequential_Drug_Fitting.m" code for fitting 100x and 1000x dilution seeded sequential drug treatment time-kill curves (e.g., Fig 6 c-d, f-g, i-j and Fig S8). All other folders and files are named with their corresponding figure number.
